                            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                            <p>Today I learned how to use some features found in JavaScript, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Creating functions & calling them through events.</li>
                                <li>Creating a pop-up box to appear when the function is called.</li>
                                <li>Creating variables and assigning values.</li>
                                <li>Using the question mark operator (known as the ternary operator) to assign a value to a variable based on another variable.</li>
                                <li>Using const(ant) variables to learn that they are variables thats value can not be changed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Here is some images to show my work:</p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry2/jscode.png" alt="JavaScript Code">

                            </figure>
                            <br />

                            <h3>JAVASCRIPT  BUTTONS!!!</h3>
                            <p>Here's a few functions I created. These buttons have a onclick event, that executes a script when the user clicks on the button.</p>
                            <button onclick="popupHelloWorld()">Hello World</button>
                            <button onclick="changeToDate(this)">Click for Date</button>
                            <button onclick="document.getElementById('clickMeButtonText').innerHTML = 'You clicked the button!'">Click Me</button>
                            <span id="clickMeButtonText"></span>
                            <button onclick="variables()">Variables</button>
                            <p>(These display on popups, therefore if you have an extension enable to block popups, you'll need to disable it to see these work.)</p>
                            <br />

                            <h3>CSS</h3>
                            <p>
                                I also added onto my CSS from the last entry. The last entry, I had already looked into using selectors such as :hover, and used this to change the style of some elements on the webpages.
                                Today, I seen that we can use CSS to change the font of text on a webpage. I looked into attempting to import a custom font to use on the webpage, which I was able to achieve with the help of Google Fonts.
                                I set the font of the footer text to appear as 'Roboto', and to fall back on Sans-Serif followed by Serif if the font is unable to load.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Practical Work</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Web Accessibility</h4>
                            <p>Through looking at the accessibility of practical_1, I had added a few changes to make the webpage more accessible, which were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I added links at the top and bottom of the page to allow the user to jump directly to where they want to be. </li>
                                <li>I modified the 'alt' attribute of the image on the webpage to provide a better description of the image. </li>
                                <li>I added a summary to the table to provide a brief summary of what information is being shown.</li>
                                <li>I also added the border attribute to the table to show a border in the event the stylesheet does not display.</li>
                                <li>I changed the buttons on the form to inputs, and added the value attribute to describe what the buttons do.</li>
                                <li>I had already assigned a label to each of the text inputs before their input tag, therefore no changes were made here.</li>
                                <li>I had already assigned a label to the radio buttons and check boxes after their input tag, therefore no changes were made here.</li>
                                <li>I added the 'title' attribute to each of the input and textarea tags to describe their value.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Introduction to JavaScript - ImageSwap</h4>
                            <p>The webpage that I'm going to talk about in this section is available <a href="../javascript_intro/index.html" target="_BLANK">here.</a></p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="#" alt="Document Object Model of Image Swap">
                                <figcaption>Fig.3 Drawing of the Document Object Model for the ImageSwap webpage.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry2/mousejs.png" alt="HTML and JavaScript Code that flips image when hovering over image">
                                <figcaption>Fig.4 HTML and JavaScript Code that changes the image when the user hovers over it.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                The code seen in fig.4 shows an image and makes the image a link. The link uses two JavaScript events, which are 'onmouseover' and 'onmouseout'. These events are triggered using the mouse.
                                Once the user moves their mouse over the image, the event 'onmouseover' is called, which finds the photo and modifies the source (src) to a new value.
                                When the user moves their mouse out of the image, the event 'onmouseout' is called, finding the photo again and modifying the source again.
                                The photo is able to be found in the document as the img tag has an attribute 'name', containing the value 'photo', which the events use. 
                                This action can be seen in fig.5 below.
                            </p>

                                <img src="media/entry2/mouseover.gif" alt="Animated image showing the effect of the cursor moving over the image.">
                                <figcaption>Fig.5 Animated image showing the image swap when the cursor moves over the image.</figcaption>
