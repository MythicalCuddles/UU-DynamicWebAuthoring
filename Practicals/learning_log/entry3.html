                            <p>
                                For this task, the code seen in Fig.1 was given and the task was to explain each of the JavaScript statements. 
                                I've added comments to the code, which describe what each line is doing, which can be seen in Fig.1.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                                Each of the statements amending the value in the variable 'myAge' through the use of different uses of symbols. 
                                As such, we're able to add, multiply, divide and subtract numbers from variables by using these.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                            <h3>Hands on with JS</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this task, the code seen in in Fig.2 was also given. The task involved adding JavaScript code inbetween the script elements.
                                However, the use of the comments do not prevent the script from running.
                                We can see two ways that comments are being used, which are '&#60;&#33;--', '-->' and '//',
                                but these comment tags are limited in use. Usually, '&#60;&#33;--' & '-->'are used for HTML commenting, and are not used by JavaScript, which is why they show as errors.
                                We are able to use '//' comments in JavaScript, which is the comment tag for JS, but only for single line comments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can see the output of the code from Fig.2 in Fig.3, which just writes "My age is 49" to the webpage.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry3/p3t2.png" alt="JavaScript Code">
                                <figcaption>Fig.2 - Using comments within the script element block.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry3/p3t2r1.png" alt="Output of JavaScript Code">

                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                We are able to perform many different actions within the script tags. As seen in Fig.4, I took the code seen in Fig.1 and added it to the script block.
                                The output can then be seen in Fig.5.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                            <br />

                            <h3>More JS</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this task, it is made clear that strings can also be amended to the end of another string in a variable.
                                We can add two strings together using the plus operator. The use of the plus equals operator as seen in Fig.6 allows for the string to be added to the current value of the variable, without needing to reference the variable again.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry3/p3t3.png" alt="JavaScript Code">
                                <figcaption>Fig.6 - JavaScript Code showing string concatenation into a variable.</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                As seen in Fig.7, the output of the JavaScript code in Fig.6 is just the three strings concatenated into one string.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                            <h3>Error Identification</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this part of the practical, a block of code was given with <strong>6</strong> errors in the code. 
                                The code seen below in Fig.8 shows the given code which has been fixed. I've added comments to each line where an error was found. 
                            </p>
