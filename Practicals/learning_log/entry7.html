                            <h3>Nested Loop Explaining</h3>
                            <p>
                                For the first task, I created the nested loop file and left a comment explaining what each line does, which can be seen in Fig.1.
                                The code contains two loops, one inside the other. The outside loop runs the inside loop a total of 3 times over.
                                The inside loop, whilst running each time, loops 5 times within the outside loop.
                                As you can see in Fig.1, I have an expected output, which has been left in a comment. This output can been seen in Fig.2

                            <h3>Car Insurance Candidate Classification</h3>
                            <p>
                                The second task required creating a website for a Car Insurance Candidate Classification.
                                The user would be required to input their information, and a calculation would be made to determine which class they belong to.
                                As seen in Fig.3, all the inputs are stored in a variable. The age is then checked to be a valid (as in a number). If it is not, the user is alerted to this issue.
                                The insurance class is then worked out by running if statements. The outside if checks the users age. Then nested if statements check to see if the user is married.
                                Depending on which of these values are true will change the insurance class, which is saved to a variable and outputted at the end of the function.
                                The output can be seen for the user as such in Fig.4
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <h3>Car Insurance Candidate Classification Validation</h3>
                            <p>
                                The if statements seen in Fig.5 can be added to the code seen in Fig.3 above to add extra validation to the form and user inputs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Firstly, we're able to check to see if the user has filled in all the fields on the form. I was able to do this by checking that the variables which store the users input were not null.
                                If any of the variables came back as null, the user would be alerted to this issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next, a regex expression can be used to check that the forename and surname being used only contains characters. The expression only allows for characters from A-Z, both lower and uppercase.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, I check that the user is old enough to drive. If the user is under the age of 17, they are alerted that they are too young for car insurance.
                            </p>
