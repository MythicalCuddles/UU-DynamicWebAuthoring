                            <h3>Checking Text Input Fields</h3>
                            <p>
                                From Fig.1, once the user has entered their name into the textbox, and clicked display, the t1DisplayName() function is ran.
                                This collects the value stored within the textbox, and changes the title in the webpage, allowing the name to be displayed there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The code in Fig.1 has been amended to check the users input. If the user has inputted a value, the title will be changed.
                                However, if the user has not inputted a value, a popup alert box will be shown to the user alerting them that a value is needed before pressing the button.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                            <h3>Checking Radio Button Inputs</h3>
                            <p>
                                Like the textboxes shown above, we are also able to see which which radio buttons users have selected in the form.
                                Using JavaScript, I was also display more radio buttons if the user selected University of Ulster as their attending university, which can be seen in Fig.4.
                                This allows the user to also input their campus they attend if they select Ulster University, which will also be added to the output.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t2display.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.3 - Form to have user input their details</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t2change.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.4 - Form changes depending on input</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                Once the user is happy with their selection and inputs, they can click the display button, which will collect the information the user has provided and display it on a webpage.
                                This can be seen in Fig.5
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t2output.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.5 - Name displayed in title when inputted and submitted.</figcaption>

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I was able to use the checked property of the radio buttons to compare which radio buttons were selected by the user.
                                Using the checked property, as seen in Fig.6 and Fig.7, I was able to check to see if the user had selected the radio button, and amend variables based on their selection, which I was able to use in the output seen in Fig.5.
                            </p>
                            <figure>

                            <h3>Checking Grades</h3>
                            <p>
                                For this task, I created a form that allowed the user to input four values (Fig.8). The code will take these four values and calculate the average before outputting the result to the user.
                                Once the user has entered their marks, they can click "Calculate Average" which will run a function to calculate their average mark and display it as an output, which can be seen in Fig.9.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t3display.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.8 - Form waiting for user input of their marks.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t3output.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.9 - Output of Fig.8.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                The code seen in Fig.10 gathers the users inputs stores them into variables.
                                A if statement allows for a check to be run, using a function isNaN(), which checks to see if the variable is not a number.
                                If this is the case, an alert is sent, and a return statement prevents the function from continuing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another if statement is placed to see if the user has inputted numbers between 0 and 100. 
                                The user is able to input decimals into the textboxes, which will also work in the calculateAverage() function.
                                If any of their inputted marks are above 100, or below 0, they are alerted that their input is invalid.
                                And like above, a return statement is also used to stop the function from continuing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the checks have been preformed, the average mark is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the total amount of values given (in this case, 4).
                                The average mark is outputted to the user.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t3p1.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.10 - JavaScript to calculate average mark.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                I was able to use an if statement to cycle through multiple conditions to find the users grade. 
                                If the average mark falls within one of these branches, a grade is given and finally outputted to the user.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="media/entry6/t3p2.png" alt="">
                                <figcaption>Fig.11 - JavaScript to get grade from average mark.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                Like if statements, I can also use a switch statement to run through multiple conditions.
                                As the grade is compared to each case, if the grade letter matches the case, the block within the case is ran.
                                In Fig.12, a variable, feedbackText, is set to different values depending on which grade the user has from their average mark.
                                This feedback is outputted to the user, as seen above.
                            </p>
                            <figure>
